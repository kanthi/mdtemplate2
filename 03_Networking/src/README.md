# K1N9sNotes
My notes of everything IT Systems/Networking/Security Administration.



This started as consolidation of notes that I have accumulated over the years while learning and making notes. My way of taking notes was simple, save everything into respective text file. Over time it has become very difficult to find what I wanted. Hence after some research I found new liking to markdown based static book/site generators.

I am using mdbook for this notes. Its simple and elegant, exactly what i was looking for.

All the Linux guide/labs are based on Fedora Server (release 33), the same should work for RHEL8 / CentOS8 too, with little or no changes. 

Why I chose Fedora Linux ? Being a RHCE myself, its a right choice and also I am working on building custom solutions based on CentOS / Fedora
